- This branch (main) is for a Teensy 4.1 using the [Deftaudio 8x8 midi+usb breakout board](https://www.tindie.com/products/deftaudio/teensy-41-midi-breakout-board-8in-8out-usb-host/)
- The [Arduino branch](https://github.com/doctea/usb_midi_clocker/tree/arduino_version) is lacking most of the features, but works on an Arduino Uno with a USB Host Shield, CV outputs, and an Akai APCMini over USB.  (The Teensy version supports connecting a Uno running the Arduino version as a USB MIDI device to add extra clock outputs - use [USBMidiKliK](https://github.com/TheKikGen/USBMidiKliK) to turn the Arduino into a native USB MIDI device and configure it with pid=0x1337, vid=0x1337).
- This project should be considered work-in-progress/beta -- don't trust it for anything mission-critical!  Although it has been known to run for 12 hour stretches without crashing, it has started locking up quite frequently lately for unknown reasons (usually crashing/freezing during USB operations from what I can tell)

# usb_midi_clocker

This can be used as the clock generator and a USB MIDI hub to your Eurorack system, and more.

It allows making use of USB-MIDI devices (eg Akai APCMini and MPK49, original Arturia Beatstep and Keystep, Modal CraftSynth 2.0), syncing USB and din MIDI devices as well as Eurorack CV clock and triggers on multiple outputs with selectable divisions and sequencer controlled by APCMini interface.

Fundamentally I guess the aim is to tie together and make useful, in a Eurorack context, multiple cheap MIDI devices by clocking serial MIDI, USB MIDI, and eurorack from the same clock source.

Uses a TFT screen and a rotary encoder and buttons to control options.  Saves to SD with functions such as unlimited projects, per-project sequences that store and recall clock divisions and sequencer patterns, a MIDI looper, etc.  Option to auto-advance through these sequences/loops for rudimentary song chaining.

# Use and contributing

Both are encouraged, I would love to have this be useful to others and to accept contributions to add features, fix bugs, make it easier to use, tweakable for your needs.  Drop me a message or open an issue if you're thinking of giving it a try or need any assistance!

  - Deftaudio 8x8 midi board (or DIY'd serial MIDI ins&outs)
- ST7789 oled screen for display
  - small screen option https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/adafruit-1-14-240x135-color-tft-display-microsd-card-breakout-st7789
  - larger screen option https://www.amazon.co.uk/Waveshare-TFT-Touch-Shield-Resolution/dp/B00W9BMTVG using "ST7789_t3_Big" menu

- DIY'd circuit to shift 3.3v Teensy IO up to 5v to be used as clock/sequencer triggers, and to protect the Teensy pins from external voltages: see 'Suggested wiring' section below
  - I am now using one of these: [Level shifter breakout](https://coolcomponents.co.uk/products/level-shifter-8-channel-txs01018e) (see 'Suggested wiring', these need extra resistors in the output path to work properly!)

- Note: as of 2022-04-25, needs patched version of the usbhost_t36 library from here https://github.com/doctea/USBHost_t36 due to https://github.com/PaulStoffregen/USBHost_t36/issues/86
  - on 2022-12-23, I recommend you use the maybe_fixed_4_stable branch as this seems like it might be more stable..?
- As of 2022-12-23, using [this LinkedList fork](https://github.com/vortigont/LinkedList) to try and improve stuff

## Suggested wiring 

- Careful with this, consider it untested for now -- this is how I have mine connected up.  If you follow this then double-check that it actually makes sense when looking at the datasheets+pin diagrams for the actual Teensy and level-shifter boards before you power it on and risk frying pins on your Teensy!  I accept no responsibility if this breaks anything!

## Known issues (current)

- Occasional freezes/crashes... pretty sure related to something in the USB library
- GDB debug mode doesn't work
- MIDI looper quantiser: Some notes get lost/mangled when quantising looper; need a bit cleverer logic to ensure that a playable note is always created
- Think it may be be a couple of BPM slower in practice than what is actually set -- maybe rounding error in how tick length is calculated?  or due to a loop taking too long and missing the tick?
- Sometimes crashes the first time that one of the Parameter submenus is opened... but works after its rebooted..

## Known issues (may be solved)

- Although it has been known run for many hours solidly, been getting some occasional crashes lately (especially while working on the looper code, though unsure if this is related).  Might be because of bugs in my attempt to patch the problem with the USBHost_t36 USB MIDI clock problem...
- ~~MIDI loop output to USB devices behaves very strangely... missed notes, stuck notes, glitching.... but it works more reliably if host is connected to the debug serial output?!  Think maybe a problem in the underlying USBHost_t36 code?~~
  - notes work fine though if sending clock is disabled?!
  - and MIDI that comes in from USB device eg beatstep and then sent to the same output device seems to work ok regardless?
  - something to do with USB/MIDI buffers I guess?  maybe isn't getting flushed properly or messages get trashed before being sent?
  - but why would that only affect loops that are playing back?
  - really don't know what's going on here :(
  - workaround for the time being is to use hardware serial MIDI when notes+clock are needed
  - hmm, may have worked around this by sending looper notes before sending clocks, in a do_pre_clock() function...?
    - OK so yeah, problem seems to have been solved by sending the note on/offs in a separate loop before then sending all the clocks in a separate loop.
- ~~Beatstep sysex commands don't work, probably for the same reason?~~
- MIDI looper uses a LOT of RAM (~48k for 1 phrase -- 384 (ticks) * 127 (notes)) - less memory-hungry polyphony can be used, but drawing the pianoroll to screen would become more intensive...
- ~~Voltage Source Calibration UI is ugly / changing sizes constantly~~
- ~~BeatStep auto-advance via SYSEX is unreliable/non-working -- had it working a few times, but couldn't work out rhyme or reason why it randomly stops working?  Left in as option.. maybe related to the same strange USB MIDI glitches as mentioned below.~~

## Configuration

- see `include/Config.h` for lots of switches to enable/disable features, set pin assignments, and the like
- `include/BootConfig.h` to turn on 'wait for serial on boot'
- see also `include/ConfigMidi.h` for a few more switches
- `src/midi_mapper_matrix_manager.cpp` is where a lot of midi device input/output mappings are initialised and defaults assigned - tweak stuff here to match your available devices
- `src/behaviour_manager.cpp` is where devices are set up and configured, so this may need tweaking to match your hardware too
- `src/menu.cpp` is where the display and menu system are initialised and menu items configured, so you may need to tweak stuff here too to match what other features you have enabled

### TODO/Future 


- stutter/machinegun mode? (eg play 32nd stabs instead of drone)
- Write up controls/instructions/etc
- Come up with a cooler name
- Update docs to reflect all features
- Visual control over the features of the [drum2musocv Bamblweeny](https://github.com/doctea/drum2musocv)?
  - Control over the envelopes AHDSR + modulation

- Configurable per-device MIDI clock divisions/multiplier
  - tricks like 'half-time beatstep for last bar of phrase'
- Full configuration of MIDI device+channel routing
- Output MIDI notes from the clock/trigger sequencer - so eg, assign kick to sequencer track#1, snare to sequencer track#2, output appropriate note on/offs on channel 10
- CC modulation
  - ~~CV-to-MIDI, for modulating MIDI devices from Eurorack CV (eg modulate the cutoff on CraftSynth from incoming CV; use the [parameters](https://github.com/doctea/parameters) library to do this)~~
    - this is mostly working now..!
      - some performance issues in reading the data, though
        - maybe if the performance problem is actually with the reading of the data, then we could hand that off to a 328p on a nano/uno to do the raw ADC processing, and communicate to the teensy via uart, or even usbserial now?
        - (or just get a dedicated CV-to-MIDI module and feed it in to the MIDI inputs)
    - some todos remain:
      - ~~reassign modulation sources~~
      - ~~load/save modulation settings~~
      - lock/hold modulation settings
      - auto-advance modulation settings?
      - modulation sources other than voltages
        - ~~MIDI CCs~~ done for first 4 faders
      - tempo-synced LFOs etc...
      - Record and playback CCs as well as MIDI
- ~~Option to 'lock/hold current' clock/sequencer/MIDI mapping settings etc when switching presets~~
- Subclocker clock multipliers as well as division (need to calculate time between ticks, and send clock on steps in between...)
- Looper improvements
  - Improve quantizer (take note length into consideration)
  - Optimise memory usage with more efficient data structure

- TODO: usbserial and for Arduino Unos without needing to use USB Midi Klik 
  - todo: see whether we need to use device unique id rather than pid+vid to ensure correct detection of mltiple devices
  - or for things that don't even talk MIDI, like eg my [veboard](https://github.com/doctea/veboard) project, or even direct Panasonic MX serial control
  - todo: implement a proof-of-concept non-MIDI usb serial device
- Transposition of everything (Beatstep etc?) in chord progressions
- Make the pc_usb connections work using behaviours
- ~~Allow to control via USB typing keyboard~~
  - ~~control the menus so that I can still fiddle with the device without disturbing my cat~~
  - shortcuts for different functions would make this something that could be performed with
  - also opens the door to allow naming of patterns/projects?
- maybe even also add VGA/HDMI output so that we're not tied to a tiny little screen..?
- Figure out how to better support MIDI features like:-
  - NPRNs
  - ~~Pitch bend~~ kinda support this now -- it is passed through at least, and allowed to be Proxied to add modulation on top of it
    - might be good to be able to enable/disable it for certain mappings tho?
  - Aftertouch
- Allow Behaviours to register CCs they respond to and can generate
  - So that can remap these as sources and targets
  - remap Bamble envelopes to CraftSynth cutoff, etc...
  - expose internal settings as Parameters, so that can have modulation mapped to them too...
- Reassignable Parameters that can be pointed at any given Behaviour+CC, configured from menus
  - expose internal settings (like bpm, clock delays...?) as Parameters, so that can have modulation mapped to them too...
- Reassignable ParameterInputs, that can be set to take their values from an incoming MIDI stream
  - Register them with the midi_matrix_mapper_manager so that when it receives a CC value change, it updates the ParameterInput current_value

## Explanation/demo (very much out of date!)

![my unit](https://github.com/doctea/usb_midi_clocker/blob/main/media/my%20unit.jpg "My unit")

(Note that the below mostly applies to the Arduino Uno version, Teensy version has a lot more going on, info here is getting a bit long in the tooth now!)

Turning into a bit of a sequencer/MIDI+USB interface/brain for controlling Eurorack and MIDI devices.

This allows a Teensy 4.1 equipped with a Deftaudio 8x8 MIDI+USB interface board to act as a USB MIDI *host* -- like an intelligent USB hub with multiple ports, so that USB MIDI devices connected to it (say keyboards or sequencers or synths) are sent MIDI clock.  This way you can sync USB MIDI devices, that don't have a normal MIDI DIN input, without connecting to a computer for DAWless usage.  Also outputs Eurorack CV clock/sequences.

This video should demonstrate what I mean a bit (old video from the Arduino Uno+USB Host Shield version!):- https://photos.google.com/photo/AF1QipNL_kUVU3N1QzCV3z4exyQTlNcGLMTfbsU7jkwI

The Arduino you see at the start of the video has a "USB Host Shield 2.0" on top and then a DIY'd 4-output CV clock shield sitting on top of that.

There's an 8-port powered USB hub plugged into the port of the USB Host Shield. Connected to that USB hub is the Akai APCmini, the Beatstep, and another [USB MIDI sequencer project of my own](https://github.com/doctea/drum2musocv) (which in turn goes off to a Eurorack MIDI-CV interface and a BitBox mk2 sampler for syncing clock and sending triggers).

This project keeps time and sends clock divisions on the CV outs, but also detects the USB MIDI devices connected to the USB hub and does a different thing for each one:-

- For the Beatstep, Keystep, Bamble, MPK49 and Subclocker it sends MIDI start, stop and clock.
- Modal CraftSynth 2.0 detected and used as a MIDI/looper output option.
- Configurable divider and delay for the Subclocker.
- MPK49 input can be recorded + saved as loops to be replayed out to selected device.
- For the APCmini it sends a display indicating the settings of the clock outputs, receives MIDI messages from the APCmini to change those settings, and lights up to indicate the current step of the sequence.
- Can use the 'master' fader on the APCmini to change tempo.
- There's also a function to resync - either immediately or at the start of the next bar -- that sends a stop followed immediately by a start to the MIDI devices, and resets the internal clock, so that everything restarts in sync (hopefully!) at beat 1.

It also has a very rudimentary sequencer, using Akai APCMini for input+display, currently overlaid over the clock outputs.
